CS248 HW1 draw-svg Writeup

Zhihan Jiang (zhihanj)
Wensi Yin (wsyin)

Task completed: task 1 - 5
task 1: Very minor difference from the reference solution
task 2: Very minor differneces from the reference solution
task 3: Easy part!
task 4: We use clamp_to_border and the white color for the edge to interpolate. The border seems a little bit lighter than the reference solution, but the center part of the image is the same.
task 5: Please kindly check ../svg/basic/task5.svg

Extra credits completed:
(1) Alpha blending - We have exact same visual effect as the reference solution in /svg/alpha/.
(2) Ellipse - Please kindly check ../svg/basic/ellipse.svg. We implement both axis-aligned and non axis-aligned.

Comments:
Very fun assignments! I wish we can have more parser to support a regular svg file (like path?). Right now a lot of the shapes generated by the online editor cannot be displayed.
